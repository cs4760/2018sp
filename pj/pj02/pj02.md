## Assignment Description

Your goal is to implement your own, simplified version of `dig(1)` that supports
querying a DNS server via UDP (by default) or TCP. This will require you to
write some code that can construct and send simple DNS query messages as well as 
parse and display DNS response messages in a similar fashion to `dig(1)`.
You should familiarize yourself with the output produced by `dig(1)` 
to understand what is expected in terms of output. 

Here is an example of a DNS response message:
```
0000   4c ce 81 80 00 01 00 06 00 00 00 01 06 67 6f 6f  L............goo
0010   67 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00 00 01 00 01 c0 0c 00 01  gle.com.........
0020   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 8b c0 0c 00 01  ........J}......
0030   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 65 c0 0c 00 01  ........J}.e....
0040   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 71 c0 0c 00 01  ........J}.q....
0050   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 8a c0 0c 00 01  ........J}......
0060   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 64 c0 0c 00 01  ........J}.d....
0070   00 01 00 00 00 06 00 04 4a 7d 88 66 00 00 29 02  ........J}.f..).
0080   00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

The format for a DNS message is documented in section 4 of 
[RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).

For this assignment, we will test your program by comparing its output to `dig(1)`.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. 

1. **Client Code (70 points):** Implement a DNS client similar to `dig(1)` that
   supports the following command line arguments:
   ```
   $ python3 dns_client.py -t TYPE [--tcp] DNSIP HOST
   ```

   * **`-t TYPE` (22 points):** Your progra needs to support creating a query for
   all of the non-obsolete, non-experimental resource record types (i.e., the `QTYPE`s) listed in 
   [Section 3.2.2 of RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.2)
   as well as `QTYPE = 255` (a request for all records). Specifically, the types you
   need to support are listed below.

     TYPE    | VALUE | DESCRIPTION
     ------- | ----- | -----------
     `A`     |   `1` | a host address
     `NS`    |   `2` | an authoritative name server
     `CNAME` |   `5` | the canonical name for an alias
     `SOA`   |   `6` | marks the start of a zone of authority
     `WKS`   |  `11` | a well known service description
     `PTR`   |  `12` | a domain name pointer
     `HINFO` |  `13` | host information
     `MINFO` |  `14` | mailbox or mail list information
     `MX`    |  `15` | mail exchange
     `TXT`   |  `16` | text strings
     `ANY`   | `255` | all records

   * **`DNSIP` (8 points):** Denotes the DNS server to use. For example, we might use
     Google's public DNS server `8.8.8.8` or another one that we have control over.

   * **`--tcp` (40 points):** By default, your connection to the DNS server should
     be done using UDP (20 points). If this command line argument is set, then your
     program should use TCP instead. Take special care to read up on what the
     trade-offs are between the two. Specifically, for UDP, you will need to consider
     various timeout and retry strategies and pick one that works best for you.

2. **Client Output (30 points):** Your client's output should try to match `dig(1)`
   as closely as possible. Regardless of the type requested in the query, your program
   may ignore resource records in the "Additional" section of the response.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (50 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `pj02`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

* **Libraries (50 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module to implement any
  networking related code. Under no circumstances, whatsoever, are you permitted
  to call any existing DNS client to earn partial credit.

* **Docstring Documentation (10 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (10 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `pj02`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 

```
$ submit pj02 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.

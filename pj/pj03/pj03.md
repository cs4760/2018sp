## Assignment Description

Your goal is to build a concurrent server and client for a 
peer-to-peer text file transfer protocol of your own design 
over TCP. 
At high level, this will be one protocol. At a low-level,
it may involve the creation of two protocols, one for client-server
communication and another for client-client transfer.
The grand feature of this sofware project is the ability to facilitate
parallel and concurrent file transfers with user-specified buffer sizes.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. Also, the terms "client" and "server" below
are used in their general sense. It may be the case that one program needs
both a client a socket and a server socket to function correctly. That
design choice is left up to the implementer. Remember, you are only allowed
two server sockets per host per transfer-layer protocol since you are only 
assigned two port numbers.

1. **Tracker Server (20 points):** None of the transfer data should go through 
   the *tracker* server. All transfers are peer-to-peer (i.e., from sender client to 
   receiver client). The purpose of the tracker server is to:

   1. Issue receiver clients an identificiation number upon request;
   2. Issue sender clients connection information, given a receiver client's identification
      number, upon request; and 
   3. Keep track of receiever clients in order to facilitate a protocol
      based around the communication generally described above.  

   Here is an example of what using the server should look like:
   ```
   $ python3 ftserver.py [--port PORT]
   ```
   Interruption via `^C` should communicate with clients that everything is
   finished. Beyond this general description, the underlying communication 
   protocol is up to you.

2. **Client (60 points):** The client code is used to setup a client to send or
   receive a file, depending on what mode its in. The details of theunderlying
   communication protocol is up to you as long as it follows the guidelines
   mentioned in these requirements.

   * **Receiver Client (30 points):** When the client is in "receive" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is the usage statement for a receiver client:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server HOST:PORT [-s SIZE] [-p PORT] --receive 
     ```
     * Required Arguments:
       * `--server HOST:PORT` - specifies the host and port of the tracker server.
       * `--receive` - indicates that the client is in "receive" mode.
     * Optional Arguments:
       * `-s SIZE` or `--size SIZE` - specifies that your client's `recv` buffer size is `SIZE` (default 4096).
       * `-p PORT` or `--port PORT` - specifies the port that this receiver client will use for its server socket (default to one of your assigned ports).

     Here is an example of what using the client in "receive" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 --receive
     Buffer size set to 4096!
     Using port 4760!
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about an identification number...
     Issued 'ID' for identification...
     Receiving 'filename.txt' over 4 connections at time 1522857661.8620028...
     Transfer completed at time 1522857674.956544 in 13.094541072845459 seconds!
     ```
     In the above example, `ID` should be replaced with a unique identifaction number.

     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished. It also looks like the sender chose to use 4 concurrent connections
     in attempt to speedup their transer.
     
     On the receiving side, transfered files should be placed in the present working directory.
     Transfers should fail if a file already exists. Newly created files should have default
     mode permissions as defined by the complement of the user's *umask*. 
     
     A client in receive mode should be able to receive multiple, distinct files
     concurrently.

   * **Sender Client (30 points):** When the client is in "send" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is the usage statement for a receiver client:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server HOST:PORT [-c CNUM] [-s SIZE] --send ID FILE 
     ```
     * Required Arguments:
       * `--server HOST:PORT` - specifies the host and port of the tracker server.
       * `--send` - indicates that the client is in "send" mode.
       * `ID` - the identification number of the receiver client.
       * `FILE` - the path of a file to send.
     * Optional Arguments:
       * `-c CNUM` or `--cons CNUM` - specifies the number of parallel, concurrent connections to use when sending (default 1).
       * `-s SIZE` or `--size SIZE` - specifies that your client's `recv` buffer size is `SIZE` (default 4096).

     Here is an example of what using the client in "send" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 -c 2 --send ID filename.txt
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about 'ID'...
     Found client at '128.192.101.135:4761'...
     Sending 'filename.txt' over 2 connections...
     Transfer complete!
     ```
     In the above example, the sender client attempts to send a file using
     two concurrent connections and the default buffer size.

     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished.

3. **Experiment Report (20 points):** You need to provide a PDF file containing the
   results of an experiment that answers the following primary question: Given your
   implementation, what is the optimal combination of buffer size and number of
   concurrent connections when transfering files between different hosts on the Nike
   virtual cluster?
   You should provide the timing results for all of the combinations you try. Please
   include cool looking, yet informative, graphs and charts. In addition to a cover
   page, Your report should contain at least one page for each of the following 
   sections:

   * **Introduction (5 points):** Introduce the problem that you are trying to solve.
     Why is it important?

   * **Methods (5 points):** Explain the design of your expirement. 
     How are you performing your experiment? Here are some
     more questions to consider: For each combination that you test, how many times 
     do you test it? Are you reporting the averages and standard deviations? How can
     someone go about reproducing your results?

   * **Result and Discussion (5 points):** What are the results? You should include a summary (i.e.,
     averages, standard deviations, etc.) of your results in this part of the paper.
     The actual data points for your experiment should be stored in a `.csv` file
     along with your project description. Please reference this `.csv` file when
     discussing results. The is also where some cool graphs and charts might go.

   * **Conclusions (5 points):** What did you conclude and why?

   In addition to the sections above, your paper should include a title page
   with author information. Also, the report should be clearly written, and it 
   should be presented in single spaced, size 10 Times New Roman font.

### Extra Credit

* **Extra Credit (5, 10, or 15 points):** The top three groups will earn 5, 10, or 15
  additional points for third, second, and first place, respectively. Groups will be 
  competing to see who can *consistently* get the best transfer times for relatively
  large files (e.g., bigger than 100MB) using their optimal number of connections and
  buffer sizes. In order to compete, students must have submitted their project by
  the official deadline, attend the last day of class, and demo their project in
  front of the whole class with a file provided by the instructor.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (25 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw03`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Your client and server application should start in `ftclient.py` and 
  `ftserver.py`, respectively.

* **Libraries (25 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module, if needed, to 
  implement any networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (5 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (5 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

* **Markdown Format (5 points):** Each `.md` file should be written in clear
  Markdown format with every effort made to keep each line under 80 columns
  in length. Exceptions may be made for lines containing hyperlinks. 

1. **Protocol Documentation (5 points):** In your `README.md` file, please document
   your underlying communication protocol. Some questions to consider when providing
   your description: Is it text based? Is it byte packed? Did
   you compress the data being transfered?

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do you handle `^C` (i.e., the interrupt signal)?**

   In Python, there are at least two ways to handle `SIGINT`. One way is to use the 
   [`signal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html) function to register a signal
   handler, similar to what you learned in the Systems Programming class. Another way is
   to catch the [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt)
   exception in your `main` as seen
   [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1188086), however this does involve slightly
   restructuring the entrypoint into your program. 

2. **What does it mean for a sender client to use `NCON`-many concurrent connections?**

   In your homework assignment, the peer-to-peer network transfer was accomplished
   by using a single socket connection between your sender and receiver. That is, it
   conceptually looked something like the following:
   ```
   +------+                     +------+
   |sendr | c.send              |recvr |
   |client| ------------------> |client|
   +------+                     +------+
   ```
   Here is what the sender and receiver FSMs *might* look like to accomplish this:
   ```
   +-------+                +---------+
   |sending| <----------\   |receiving| <--------\
   +-------+            |   +---------+          |
     | |                |     | |                |
     | \----------------/     | \----------------/
     |   data remaining       |   data remaining
     |      {c.send}          |     {c.recv}
     |                        |
     | no data                | no data
     | remaining              | remaining
     V                        V
   +----+                   +----+
   |done|                   |done|
   +----+                   +----+
   ```

   With this project, you need so support sending and receiving using multiple
   connections. This can be accomplished establishing multiple connections to
   the receiver client and sending the data in multiple threads. Suppose you
   have a 1024 byte file that you want to send over 4 conncurrent connections.
   This can be done by breaking up the file into 4 parts of length 256. You
   should be able to send all 4 parts simultaneously using 4 threads, each with
   one socket connection per thread. That is, it conceptually looks something
   like the following:
   ```
   +------+ ------------------> +------+
   |sendr | ------------------> |recvr |
   |client| ------------------> |client|
   +------+ ------------------> +------+
   ```
   Here is what the sender FSM *might* look like to accomplish this:
   ```
         MAIN THREAD                               SENDING THREAD #N
   +---------+                               +-------+
   |preparing|                               |sending| <-----------------\
   +---------+                               +-------+                   |
       |                                       | |                       |
       | thread started                        | \-----------------------/
       | for each part                         |   part N data remaining
       V                                       |     {c1.send(part1)}
   +-------+ all sending threads  +----+       |
   |sending| -------------------> |done|       | no part N data
   +-------+       are done       +----+       | remaining
                                               V
                                             +------+
                                             |almost| inform main thread +----+
                                             | done | ------------------>|done|
                                             +------+                    +----+
   ```
   While not mentioned here, you will obviously need to adjust your receiving
   client to accommodate this scheme. In general, this adds some more complexity 
   to your overall protocol. Keep this in mind when implementing and especially 
   when documenting your protocol.

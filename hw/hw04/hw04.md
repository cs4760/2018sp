## Assignment Description

Your goal is to build a simple, concurrent server and client for a relatively 
simple client-to-client text file transfer protocol over TCP. 

Here is a usage scenario: Suppose you have three hosts: client 1, client 2, and
a server. Furthermore, suppose that the server is running your server code. 

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. In the requirements below, let `P1` and `P2` denote your two
assigned ports, respectively. Also, the terms "client" and "server" below
are used in their general sense. It may be the case that one program needs
both a client a socket and a server socket to function correctly. That
design choice is left up to the implementer.

1. **Server (50 points):** Your server needs to 

2. **Client (50 points):**  

   * **Receive Mode (25 points):** When the client is in "receive" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is an example of what using the client in "receive" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 --receive
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about an identification number...
     Issued 'ID' for identification...
     Receiving 'filename.txt'...
     Transfer complete!
     ```
     In the above example, `ID` should be replaced with a unique identifaction number.
     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished.

   * **Send Mode (25 points):** When the client is in "send" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is an example of what using the client in "send" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 --send ID filename.txt
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about 'ID'...
     Found client at '128.192.101.135:4761'...
     Sending 'filename.txt'...
     Transfer complete!
     ```
     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished.

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (25 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw03`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Your client and server application should start in `ftclient.py` and 
  `ftserver.py`, respectively.

* **Libraries (25 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module, if needed, to 
  implement any networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (5 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (5 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

* **Markdown Format (5 points):** Each `.md` file should be written in clear
  Markdown format with every effort made to keep each line under 80 columns
  in length. Exceptions may be made for lines containing hyperlinks. 

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `hw03`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 
```
$ submit hw03 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.

## Assignment Description

Your goal is to build a simple, concurrent server and client for a 
client-to-client text file transfer protocol of your own design 
over TCP. At high level, this will be one protocol. At a low-level,
it may involve the creation of two protocols, one for client-server
communication and another for client-client transfer.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. Also, the terms "client" and "server" below
are used in their general sense. It may be the case that one program needs
both a client a socket and a server socket to function correctly. That
design choice is left up to the implementer. Remember, you are only allowed
two server sockets per host per transfer-layer protocol since you are only 
assigned two port numbers.

1. **Server (40 points):** None of the transfer data should go through the 
   server. All transfers are from client to client. The purpose of the
   server is to keep track of what clients are running and in "receive" mode
   as well as to issue such clients a unique identification number.

   Here is an example of what using the server should look like:
   ```
   $ python3 ftserver.py
   ```
   Interruption via `^C` should communicate with clients that everything is
   finished. Beyond this general description, the underlying communication 
   protocol is up to you.

2. **Client (50 points):** The client code is used to setup a client to send or
   receive a file, depending on what mode its in. It is recommended that you send and
   receive files in chunk. Beyond this general description, the underlying
   communication protocol is up to you.

   * **Receive Mode (25 points):** When the client is in "receive" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is an example of what using the client in "receive" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 --receive
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about an identification number...
     Issued 'ID' for identification...
     Receiving 'filename.txt'...
     Transfer complete!
     ```
     In the above example, `ID` should be replaced with a unique identifaction number.
     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished. 
     
     Transfered files should be placed in the present working directory. Transfers
     should fail if a file already exists. Newly created files should have default
     mode permissions as defined by the complement of the user's umask. 
     
     A client in receive mode should be able to receive multiple, distinct files
     concurrently. 

   * **Send Mode (25 points):** When the client is in "send" mode, it will
     ask the indicated server for a unique identifaction number. Once issued, this
     number can be used with a client in "send" mode to send a file to the receiving
     client.

     Here is an example of what using the client in "send" mode should look like:
     ```
     $ python3 ftclient.py --server vcf3:4760 --send ID filename.txt
     Asking 'vcf3:4760' about 'ID'...
     Found client at '128.192.101.135:4761'...
     Sending 'filename.txt'...
     Transfer complete!
     ```
     Transfer completion or interruption via `^C` should communicate that the client
     is finished.
     
1. **Protocol Documentation (10 points):** In your `README.md` file, please document
   your underlying communication protocol. Some questions to consider when providing
   your description: Is it text based? Is it byte packed? Did
   you compress the data being transfered?

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (25 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw03`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

  Your client and server application should start in `ftclient.py` and 
  `ftserver.py`, respectively.

* **Libraries (25 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module, if needed, to 
  implement any networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (5 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (5 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

* **Markdown Format (5 points):** Each `.md` file should be written in clear
  Markdown format with every effort made to keep each line under 80 columns
  in length. Exceptions may be made for lines containing hyperlinks. 

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `hw03`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 
```
$ submit hw04 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.

## Assignment Description

Suppose the network layer provides the following service. 
The network layer in the source host accepts a segment of maximum size 1,200 
bytes and a destination host address from the transport layer. The network layer
then guarantees to deliver the segment to the transport layer at the destination
host. Suppose many network application processes can be running at the 
destination host.

Your goal is to design the simplest possible transport-layer protocol that 
will get application data to the desired process at the destination host. 
Assume the operating system in the destination host has assigned a 4-byte port 
number to each running application process.

### Functional Requirements

Points indicated for functional requirements are added to the grade total
if satisfied. 

1. **Part 1 - RFC (60 points):** Create a RFC document, `RFC4760.md`, for your
   protocol that provides the various details about your protocol.
   At the very least, your RFC should contain the following:

   * **Segment Format (20 points):** This should outline the format of your protocol's
     transport-layer messages, including details about headers and associated fields. 
     Please draw from your experience reading the DNS RFCs when putting this section
     together. 

   * **Sender Overview (20 points):** This should be a high level overview of the
     sender side of your protocol, including any assumptiona the reader should can or 
     should make about its design.

   * **Receiver Overview (20 points):** This should be a high level overview of the
     receiver side of your protocol, including any assumptiona the reader should can or 
     should make about its design.

2. **Part 2 - Modification (20 points):**  Create a file called `MODIFICATION.md` that
   answers the following question: How would you modify your protocol so that it
   provides a "return address" to the destination process? Explain.

3. **Part 3 - Reflection (20 points):** Create a file called `REFLECTION.md` that
   answers the following question: In your protocols, does the transport layer 
   "have to do anything" in the core of the computer network? Explain. 

### Nonfunctional Requirements 

Points indicated for non-functional requirements are not added to the grade total
if satisfied but are subtracted from the grade total if not satisfied.

* **Directory Setup (25 points):** Your submission folder should be a Python
  virtual environment, created using the `venv` module, called `hw03`.
  Your virtual environment should contain a `README.md` file that includes
  the following information:
  * Name and UGA ID;
  * Short description of your submission;
  * Instructions on how to activate the virtual environment;
  * Instuctions on how to run your submission; and
  * Any other information as described in this assignment description. 

* **Libraries (25 points):** For this assignment, you may use any of the Python
  Standard Library modules except `socketserver`. You are expected to use the
  low-level socket interface provided by the `socket` module, if needed, to 
  implement any networking related code. 

* **Docstring Documentation (5 points):** Each method and class needs to be documented
  using standard Python [docstring comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

* **In-line Documentation (5 points):** Code blocks should be adequately documented
  using in-line comments. This is especially necessary when a block of code
  is not immediately understood by a reader (e.g., the grader).

* **Markdown Format (5 points):** Each `.md` file should be written in clear
  Markdown format with every effort made to keep each line under 80 columns
  in length. Exceptions may be made for lines containing hyperlinks. 

## Submission Instructions

You will be submitting your project via Nike before the deadline indicated
near the top of this document. Make sure your project files are on 
`nike.cs.uga.edu`. Change into the parent directory of your project directory. 
If you've followed the instructions provided in this document, then the name 
of your project directory is likely `hw03`. 
While in your project's parent directory, execute the following command: 
```
$ submit hw03 cs4760a
```

If you have any problems submitting your project, then please contact the CSCI
4760 Support Team by sending a private post to "Instructors" via the course 
Piazza as soon as possible. 

Have a general question? Please post it on the course Piazza.
